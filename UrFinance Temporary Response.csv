14/10/2025 23:33:12,bukanmanusiabiasa@gmail.com,Data Scientist,4. Easy,"liked how simple and conversational it was. Uploading an invoice and getting structured data back felt natural, like chatting with a smart assistant. The ability to ask follow-up questions (“What’s the total amount?” “Summarize this invoice”) made it feel more interactive and AI-driven rather than a static form.","Sometimes the data extraction wasn’t 100% accurate, especially when the invoice layout was non-standard. Also, there wasn’t always clear feedback if the bot didn’t understand a question — it would just respond vaguely. A “confidence score” or clearer error message would help a lot.","1. Improve OCR accuracy and handle more diverse invoice templates (scanned, multi-language, rotated text, etc.).

2. Add clearer user feedback or “why” explanations when the bot can’t extract or answer something.

3. Allow structured export (CSV/Excel/JSON) so users can save the parsed invoice data easily.","I’d love a dashboard or summary view showing all uploaded invoices with totals, due dates, and payment statuses kind of like a mini finance tracker. Also, an integration with Google Sheets or Notion would be powerful for automation.",Handy Ruyono
